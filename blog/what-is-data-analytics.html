                        <p>Data analytics: Everyone’s talking about it, but what exactly is it?</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve heard that data analytics is the next big thing for business and want to finally understand what all the hype is about. Maybe you’re thinking about becoming a data analyst and want to know what a career in the field really involves. Either way, you’ve come to the right place!</p>
<p>In this guide, you’ll find a complete and comprehensive introduction to data analytics—starting with a simple, easy-to-understand definition and working up to some of the most important tools and techniques. We’ll also touch upon how you can start a career as a data analyst, and explore what the future holds in terms of market growth. By the end of this post, you’ll have a clear idea of what data analytics is, how it differs from data science, and what it takes to break into the field. Want to skip ahead to a specific section? Just use the clickable menu below.</p>
<div class="all-questions">
  
    <h3 id="one">1. What is data analytics?</h3>
    
    <p>Most companies are collecting loads of data all the time—but, in its raw form, this data doesn’t really mean anything. This is where data analytics comes in. Data analytics is the process of analyzing raw data in order to draw out meaningful, actionable insights. These insights are then used to inform and drive smart business decisions. So, a data analyst will extract raw data, organize it, and then analyze it, transforming it from incomprehensible numbers into coherent, intelligible information. Having interpreted the data, the data analyst will then pass on their findings in the form of suggestions or recommendations about what the company’s next steps should be.
  
  You can think of data analytics as a form of business intelligence, used to solve specific problems and challenges within an organization. It’s all about finding patterns in a dataset which can tell you something useful and relevant about a particular area of the business—how certain customer groups behave, for example, or how employees engage with a particular tool. Data analytics helps you to make sense of the past and to predict future trends and behaviors; rather than basing your decisions and strategies on guesswork, you’re making informed choices based on what the data is telling you. Armed with the insights drawn from the data, businesses and organizations are able to develop a much deeper understanding of their audience, their industry, and their company as a whole—and, as a result, are much better equipped to make decisions and plan ahead.
  
  Throughout this post, we’ll delve deeper into what data analytics is and what it looks like in action. First though, let’s clear up a common area of confusion: the difference between data analytics and data science.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="two">2. What’s the difference between data analytics and data science?</h3>
    
    <p>You’ll find that the terms “data science” and “data analytics” tend to be used interchangeably. However, they are two different fields and denote two distinct career paths. What’s more, they each have a very different impact on the business or organization.
  
  One key difference between data scientists and data analysts lies in what they do with the data and the outcomes they achieve. A data analyst will seek to answer specific questions or address particular challenges that have already been identified and are known to the business. To do this, they examine large datasets with the goal of identifying trends and patterns. They then “visualize” their findings in the form of charts, graphs, and dashboards. These visualizations are shared with key stakeholders and used to make informed, data-driven strategic decisions.
  
  A data scientist, on the other hand, considers what questions the business should or could be asking. They design new processes for data modeling, write algorithms, devise predictive models, and run custom analyses. For example: They might build a machine to leverage a dataset and automate certain actions based on that data—and, with continuous monitoring and testing, and as new patterns and trends emerge, improve and optimize that machine wherever possible. In short: data analysts tackle and solve discrete questions about data, often on request, revealing insights that can be acted upon by other stakeholders, while data scientists build systems to automate and optimize the overall functioning of the business.
  
  Another main difference lies in the tools and skills required for each role. Data analysts are typically expected to be proficient in software like Excel and, in some cases, querying and programming languages like SQL, R, SAS, and Python. Analysts need to be comfortable using such tools and languages to carry out data mining, statistical analysis, database management and reporting. Data scientists, on the other hand, might be expected to be proficient in Hadoop, Java, Python, machine learning, and object-oriented programming, together with software development, data mining, and data analysis.
  
  Despite their differences, it’s important to recognize that data science and data analytics work together, and both make extremely valuable contributions to business.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="three">3. What are the different types of data analysis?</h3>
    
    <p>Now we have a working definition of data analytics, let’s explore the four main types of data analysis: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive.</p>  
  <p>
  <h4>i) Descriptive analytics</h4>
  <p>Descriptive analytics is a simple, surface-level type of analysis that looks at what has happened in the past. The two main techniques used in descriptive analytics are data aggregation and data mining—so, the data analyst first gathers the data and presents it in a summarized format (that’s the aggregation part) and then “mines” the data to discover patterns. The data is then presented in a way that can be easily understood by a wide audience (not just data experts). It’s important to note that descriptive analytics doesn’t try to explain the historical data or establish cause-and-effect relationships; at this stage, it’s simply a case of determining and describing the “what”. Descriptive analytics draws on descriptive statistics, which you can learn about here.</p>
  
  <h4>ii) Diagnostic analytics</h4>
  <p>While descriptive analytics looks at the “what”, diagnostic analytics explores the “why”. When running diagnostic analytics, data analysts will first seek to identify anomalies within the data—that is, anything that cannot be explained by the data in front of them. For example: If the data shows that there was a sudden drop in sales for the month of March, the data analyst will need to investigate the cause. To do this, they’ll embark on what’s known as the discovery phase, identifying any additional data sources that might tell them more about why such anomalies arose. Finally, the data analyst will try to uncover causal relationships—for example, looking at any events that may correlate or correspond with the decrease in sales. At this stage, data analysts may use probability theory, regression analysis, filtering, and time-series data analytics.</p>
  
  <h4>iii) Predictive analytics</h4>
  <p>Just as the name suggests, predictive analytics tries to predict what is likely to happen in the future. This is where data analysts start to come up with actionable, data-driven insights that the company can use to inform their next steps. Predictive analytics estimates the likelihood of a future outcome based on historical data and probability theory, and while it can never be completely accurate, it does eliminate much of the guesswork from key business decisions. Predictive analytics can be used to forecast all sorts of outcomes—from what products will be most popular at a certain time, to how much the company revenue is likely to increase or decrease in a given period. Ultimately, predictive analytics is used to increase the business’s chances of “hitting the mark” and taking the most appropriate action.</p>
  
  <h4>iv) Prescriptive analytics</h4>
  <p>Building on predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics advises on the actions and decisions that should be taken. In other words, prescriptive analytics shows you how you can take advantage of the outcomes that have been predicted. When conducting prescriptive analysis, data analysts will consider a range of possible scenarios and assess the different actions the company might take. Prescriptive analytics is one of the more complex types of analysis, and may involve working with algorithms, machine learning, and computational modeling procedures. However, the effective use of prescriptive analytics can have a huge impact on the company’s decision-making process and, ultimately, on the bottom line.</p>
  
  <p>The type of analysis you carry out will also depend on the kind of data you’re working with. If you’re not already familiar, it’s worth learning about the four levels of data measurement: Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.</p>  
    
    <h3 id="four">4. What is data analytics used for?</h3>
    
    <p>By now, we’re pretty familiar with the theory behind data analytics, but it’s all still feeling rather abstract. What does data analytics actually look like in action? How is it used in the real world?
  
  The truth is, data is absolutely everywhere—which means that data analytics has almost infinite uses across all kinds of businesses and organizations. Broadly speaking, data analytics is used to make faster and more informed decisions, to reduce overall business costs, to develop more effective products and services, and to optimize processes and operations. In more specific terms, data analytics might be used for the following:</p>  
  <p>To predict future sales and purchasing behaviors</p>
  <p>For security purposes—for example, to detect, predict, and prevent fraud within the insurance and banking industries</p>
  <p>To evaluate the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns</p>
  <p>To optimize marketing efforts through more accurate targeting and personalization</p>
  <p>To identify and eliminate bottlenecks within a certain process</p>
  <p>To boost customer acquisition and retention</p>
  <p>To boost customer engagement on social media</p>
  <p>To develop risk management solutions</p>
  <p>To identify opportunities for innovation and create new revenue streams</p>
  <p>To increase supply chain efficiency</p>
  <p>The above list is by no means exhaustive; anywhere data is being collected, data analytics can be used to glean useful insights and inform future practices. Let’s now take a closer look at data analytics in action with some real-world case studies.</p>
    
    <h3 id="five">5. What does a data analyst do?</h3>
    
    <p>A job ad for a Graduate Data Analyst posted by Pareto Law describes the position as “a unique opportunity to work across all verticals as a knowledge broker, acting as an intermediary between clients and experts, connecting customers with the organization.”
  
  In their ad for a Data Analyst, Shaw Media writes: “This role will primarily focus on turning datasets into an actionable direction for our newsrooms. You will be responsible for more than just monitoring our analytics—it’s communicating with the newsroom about what is working, what is not working, updating our dashboards, identifying trends and making sure we’re on top of data privacy.”
  
  As you can see, the role of the data analyst means different things to different companies. </p>  
  
    
    <h3 id="six">6. What is the typical process that a data analyst will follow?</h3>
    
    <p>Here, we’ll outline the five main steps that a data analyst will follow when tackling a new project:
  
  The five steps in the data analysis process: Define the question, gather your data, clean the data, analyse the data, and visualize and share your findings.</p>  
  <h4>Step 1: Define the question(s) you want to answer</h4>
  <p>The first step is to identify why you are conducting analysis and what question or challenge you hope to solve. At this stage, you’ll take a clearly defined problem and come up with a relevant question or hypothesis you can test. You’ll then need to identify what kinds of data you’ll need and where it will come from. For example: A potential business problem might be that customers aren’t subscribing to a paid membership after their free trial ends. Your research question could then be “What strategies can we use to boost customer retention?”</p>
  <h4>Step 2: Collect the data</h4>
  <p>With a clear question in mind, you’re ready to start collecting your data. Data analysts will usually gather structured data from primary or internal sources, such as CRM software or email marketing tools. They may also turn to secondary or external sources, such as open data sources. These include government portals, tools like Google Trends, and data published by major organizations such as UNICEF and the World Health Organization.</p>
  <h4>Step 3: Clean the data</h4>
  <p>Once you’ve collected your data, you need to get it ready for analysis—and this means thoroughly cleaning your dataset. Your original dataset may contain duplicates, anomalies, or missing data which could distort how the data is interpreted, so these all need to be removed. Data cleaning can be a time-consuming task, but it’s crucial for obtaining accurate results.</p>
  <h4>Step 4: Analyze the data</h4>
  <p>Now for the actual analysis! How you analyze the data will depend on the question you’re asking and the kind of data you’re working with, but some common techniques include regression analysis, cluster analysis, and time-series analysis (to name just a few). We’ll go over some of these techniques in the next section. This step in the process also ties in with the four different types of analysis we looked at in section three (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive).</p>
  <h4>Step 5: Interpret and share the results</h4>
  <p>This final step in the process is where data is transformed into valuable business insights. Depending on the type of analysis conducted, you’ll present your findings in a way that others can understand—in the form of a chart or graph, for example. At this stage, you’ll demonstrate what the data analysis tells you in regards to your initial question or business challenge, and collaborate with key stakeholders on how to move forwards. This is also a good time to highlight any limitations to your data analysis and to consider what further analysis might be conducted.</p>
    
    <h3 id="seven">7. What tools and techniques do data analysts use?</h3>
    
    <p>Before we introduce some key data analytics techniques, let’s quickly distinguish between the two different types of data you might work with: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data is essentially anything measurable—for example, the number of people who answered “yes” to a particular question on a survey, or the number of sales made in a given year. Qualitative data, on the other hand, cannot be measured, and comprises things like what people say in an interview or the text written as part of an email. Data analysts will usually work with quantitative data; however, there are some roles out there that will also require you to collect and analyze qualitative data, so it’s good to have an understanding of both. With that in mind, here are some of the most common data analytics techniques:</p>  
  <h4>i) Regression analysis</h4>
  <p> This method is used to estimate or “model” the relationship between a set of variables. You might use regression analysis to see if certain variables (such as a movie star’s number of Instagram followers and how much her last five films grossed on average) can be used to accurately predict another variable (e.g. whether or not her next film will be a big hit). Regression analysis is mainly used to make predictions; however, it’s important to note that, on their own, regressions can only be used to determine whether or not there is indeed a relationship, or correlation, between a set of variables—they can’t tell you anything about cause and effect.</p>
  <h4>ii) Factor analysis</h4>
  <p> This technique helps data analysts to uncover the latent or underlying variables that drive people’s behavior and the choices they make. Ultimately, it condenses the data in many variables into a few “super-variables”, making the data easier to work with. For example: If you have three different variables which represent customer satisfaction, you might use factor analysis to condense these variables into just one all-encompassing customer satisfaction score. For this reason, factor analysis is sometimes known as dimension reduction</p>
  <h4>iii) Cohort analysis</h4>
  <p>A cohort is a group of users who have a certain characteristic in common within a specified time period—for example, all customers who purchased using a mobile device in March may be considered as one distinct group or cohort. In cohort analysis, customer data is broken up into smaller groups or cohorts; so, instead of treating all customer data the same, companies can see trends and patterns over time that relate to particular cohorts. In recognizing these patterns, companies are then able to offer a more targeted service.</p>
  <h4>iv) Cluster analysis</h4>
  <p>This technique is all about identifying structures within a dataset. Cluster analysis essentially segments the data into groups that are internally homogenous and externally heterogeneous—in other words, the objects in one cluster must be more similar to each other than they are to the objects in other clusters. Cluster analysis enables you to see how data is distributed across a dataset where there are no existing predefined classes or groupings. In marketing, for example, cluster analysis may be used to identify distinct target groups within a larger customer base.</p>
  <h4>v) Time-series analysis</h4>
  <p>In simple terms, time-series data is a sequence of data points which measure the same variable at different points in time. Time-series analysis, then, is the collection of data at specific intervals over a period of time in order to identify trends and cycles. This is useful because it enables data analysts to make accurate forecasts for the future. For example, if you wanted to predict the future demand for a particular product, you might use time-series analysis to see how the demand for this product typically looks at certain points in time.</p>
  <p>These are just a few of the many techniques that data analysts will use, and we’ve only scratched the surface in terms of what each technique involves and how it’s used. Some other common techniques include Monte Carlo simulations, dispersion analysis, discriminant analysis, and text or content analysis (the latter being a technique for analyzing qualitative data).</p>
